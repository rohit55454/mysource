>	in Lab3B if we comment print statements of stu.getEmails(), stu.getMarks(), stu.getPhone(), stu.getRefs(); then also courses(array) will be loaded. Arrays are loaded aggressively in comparison of List, Set, Map etc. The loading of collection is also referred as lazy loading.

>	load() is implemented as follows :
		
		String sql = "select * from students";
		ps = con.preparestatement(sql);
		rs = ps.executeQuery();
		if(rs.next()){
			Student stu = new Student();
			stu.setters.......
		}else{
			throw new ObjectNotFoundException();
		}

>	alternative for load() is set().
